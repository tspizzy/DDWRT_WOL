# DDWRT_WOL
Remotely WOL a device via your DD-WRT equipped router

## Requirements
- DD-WRT installed on your router
- Telnet Enabled
- You must know the WAN IP of the router, or DDNS name

## Configuration
- in the DDWRT_WOL.py file, add your credentials to the quoted areas, within the quotes. e.g. password = 'your_password'

## Other notes
I realize this isn't particularly secure, but it works and it's handy. If you have a suggestion on how to make it more secure, let me know!
